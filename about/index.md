You can know more about me in the [homepage](/).

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [setImpl](http://lhzhang.com/) by Linghua Zhang; the homepage was based on the design of [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/). And this paragraph is actually copied from [Yihui Xia](http://yihui.name/en/about).

You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/chenlinwang/).
