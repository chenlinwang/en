Pointer has been an eccential part of the _C_ language. We could use the pointer to specificly manipulate the data saved in the memory. We all know that a pointer, no matter what it points to, will take up 8 bytes. Thus it is certainly normal to think that we could ramdonly assign the pointer data value to different type of the pointer like:

```c
int i = 's';
char * cp = &i; //Compile Warming!
```

The main cousre of the warming is that, an `int` takes up 4 bytes in memory but the char takes up only 1 bytes. Thus if we did the above. The character pointer `cp` is actually pointing to the front byte of the 4 bytes of the `int`. And if we do the opposite thing, namely let a integer pointer point to a character, the integer pointer is actually pointing to the 1 byte of the character, together with the 3 bytes that follows, which we have no idea what it is about.
This characteristic could be used in determining whether a computer's  encodings, the big or the en.

The void pointer is a data type that allow any data type pointer to assign to. These could save the problem.
We could define the void pointer like:

```c
void * vp;
```
